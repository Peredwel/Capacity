<h3>Andrew McCann is Trying to Organize Things</h3>
I am originally a biophysicist, and now a learning computer scientist. More often than not, you can find me drinking good coffee and listening to rap music. I am going to help build the back-end while trying to keep our project on track.

<h3>Sean Marchand is Making Our Front End Make Sense</h3>
I am studying computer science, but most people know me either as #99 for the NobleKing Knights hockey team. If anyone wants to challenge me to a game of chess, good luck. I think this project is pretty neat and I'll be working on the front end.

<h3>Ryan Chen is Learning Fast and Having Fun</h3>
In my spare time, I try to soak in as much new information as possible. Although I am the official minute taker of Capacity, I also plan to have more fun than anyone else while working on the back-end.

<h3>Victor Shi is Making This App Beautiful</h3>
I am studying computer science and philosophy, and I am always eager to work on things that excite me. In my free time, I love to read and dance (pop). For this project, I am working on the front-end which means someone else has to do the ~~hard work~~ back-end.
