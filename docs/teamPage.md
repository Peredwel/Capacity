### Andrew McCann is Trying to Organize Things
I am originally a biophysicist, and now a learning computer scientist. More often than not, you can find me drinking good coffee and listening to rap music. I am going to help build the back-end while trying to keep our project on track.

### Samar Sajnani is Spreading His Knowledge
A passionate third year computer science student with a undergraduate degree in biochemistry. I have a background in web development and machine learning. Excited to get the backend started with Groovy on Grails.

### Sean Marchand is Making Our Front End Make Sense
I am studying computer science, but most people know me either as #99 for the NobleKing Knights hockey team. If anyone wants to challenge me to a game of chess, good luck. I think this project is pretty neat and I'll be working on the front end.

### Steven Crossman is Holding the Back-End Down
I am studying computer science, and know my way around Java and Python. I love to game and hang out with my friends in my downtime, and I am always open to try something new. I will be working on developing the back-end of our project.

### Siavash Khan is Delivering Our Front-End Experience
I am computer science student wihth past experience in game development and web development. I will be working on the front-end for this project and hope to learn a lot from this experience. Do you know what you call a guy with a rubber toe?

### Jerry Chen is Our Secret Design Weapon
I am a computer science student who likes musicals and interesting stories. Check me out [on my website](http://jyche.me/). I am going to bring my knowledge of UI and design to work on the front-end of Capacity.

### Ryan Chen is Learning Fast and Having Fun
In my spare time, I try to soak in as much new information as possible. Although I am the official minute taker of Capacity, I also plan to have more fun than anyone else while working on the back-end.

### Victor Shi is Making This App Beautiful
I am studying computer science and philosophy, and I am always eager to work on things that excite me. In my free time, I love to read and dance (pop). For this project, I am working on the front-end which means someone else has to do the ~~hard work~~ back-end.

### Chase Kelly is Our Idea Man
I am a 5th year student doing a double major in computer science and BMOS. I have experience in HTML and Java but I wish I learned Python. I will be working on the front-end development for this project and look forward to selling this product to Google for a cool billion.
