# Team Roster
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Andrew McCann is our Administrator and Back-End Developer</h3>
I am originally a biophysicist, and now a learning computer scientist. More often than not, you can find me drinking good coffee and listening to rap music. I am going to help build the back-end while trying to keep our project on track. Most notably, I developed the users and message functions of Capacity in Node and Express.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Samar Sajnani is our Back-End Developer and Connection Consultant</h3>
A passionate third year computer science student with a undergraduate degree in biochemistry. I have a background in web development and machine learning. Excited to get the backend started with Node and Express. Most notably, I implemented authentication of users and the places functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Sean Marchand is our Front-End Develeoper</h3>
I am studying computer science, but most people know me either as #99 for the NobleKing Knights hockey team. If anyone wants to challenge me to a game of chess, good luck. I think this project is pretty neat and I'll be working on the front end. Most notably contributed to the predictive search bar and heat graph.
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Steven Crossman is our Front-End Developer</h3>
I am studying computer science, and know my way around Java and Python. I love to game and hang out with my friends in my downtime, and I am always open to try something new. I will be working on developing the back-end of our project. I developed the recommended places feature.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Siavash Khan is our Front-End Developer</h3>
I am computer science student wihth past experience in game development and web development. I will be working on the front-end for this project and hope to learn a lot from this experience. Do you know what you call a guy with a rubber toe? I developed the predictive search feature and helped with the graph.
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Jerry Chen is our Front-End Master and Connection Boss</h3>
I am a computer science student who likes musicals and interesting stories. Check me out [on my website](http://jyche.me/). I am going to bring my knowledge of UI and design to work on the front-end of Capacity. I designed the UI of Capacity, and ensured that it played nicely with the backend.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Ryan Chen is our Web Administrator</h3>
In my spare time, I try to soak in as much new information as possible. Although I am the official minute taker of Capacity, I also plan to have more fun than anyone else while working on the back-end. I managed the team website throughout the process, and created data to test our application.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Victor Shi is our Back-End Developer</h3>
I am studying computer science and philosophy, and I am always eager to work on things that excite me. In my free time, I love to read and dance (pop). For this project, I am working on the front-end which means someone else has to do the ~~hard work~~ back-end. I incorporated the maps into our places, and helped developed the heat graph and UI.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Chase Kelly is our Media Content Master</h3>
I am a 5th year student doing a double major in computer science and BMOS. I have experience in HTML and Java but I wish I learned Python. I will be working on the front-end development for this project and look forward to selling this product to Google for a cool billion.
