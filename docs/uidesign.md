# UI Design

Look and feel:

 * Clean, simple, and intuitive
 * [bulma.io](bulma.io) CSS Framework for design minimalistic design
 * Inspired by Yelp (homepage), and Google (results page drop down)

User interaction:

 * Users will be able to log in, search for a location, see relevant data about the location's current capacity, and read or post messages about the location's current capacity.

Our web app will be a two-state application to keep it clear and user-intuitive.

The home page will simply consist of the search bar and top navigation bar (for user login and account info). There will be an autocomplete list of possible location results which the user can choose from. After selecting an item, the website will redirect to the corresponding place page.

A place page will display data pertaining to the location:

1. The top navigation bar will allow the user to interact with user accounts and may also have a search bar.
2. The left column will display data about the capacity by hour.
3. The centre column will have: A map of the area, its description, and extra information. Beneath will be messages from other users about the location.
4. The right column will show other suggested places similar to the current one.
