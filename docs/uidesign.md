# UI Design

Our web app will be a one-page application to keep it simple and user-intuitive. There will be a search bar and two main columns that display data.

1. The left column will have: a list of recommended places based on what the user searched, a locked map of the area, and other potential graphs.

2. The right column will have a message board that users can read and post messages to. It will have different channels that are representative of different areas, for example a global channel vs. a local channel.

Furthermore, there will be a nav bar for things like logging in and account settings that will use modals to interact with the user, maintaining a one-page application design.

Look and feel:

 * Clean, simple, and intuitive
 * [bulma.io](bulma.io) CSS Framework for design minimalistic design
 * Inspired by Yelp (homepage), Yik Yak (comments), YouTube (video page formatting), and Google (results page drop down)

User interaction:

 * Users will be able to log in, search for a location, see relevant data/graphs about the location's current capacity, and read or post messages about the location's current capacity.
